# RT's Rock, Paper Scissor Game

This is a basic online game of chance that provides the user with 3 options and
the computer making a random choice to see who comes out on top.  It is meant
to pass the time in a fun way and to envoke a sense of challenge to the user
with the a feeling of chance to win as you would playing a slot machine.

Users of the game will make decisions based on intuition and see how their
luck is challenged by the computer's random choice. Enjoy!
